How do i setup udrone software
------------------------------
udrone is very easy to setup. All custom information is stored in a central
file called conf.py

----
$ cat conf.py
conf = {
# the interface used to talk to the drones
	"ifname":"eth0",
}
----


How do i setup udrone hardware
------------------------------
In addition to the DUT you will need N drones. A drone is a OpenWrt router with
the udrone package installed. Once you have all devices, you need to set them
up in 1 of the following ways.

----

LAPTOP (eth0) -> (LAN) DRONE (WAN) -> (LAN) DUT (WAN) -> BACKEND

LAPTOP (eth0) -> (LAN) DRONE (WIFI) -> (WIFI) DUT (WAN) -> BACKEND

----

If you want to use more than just 1 Drone you will need to switches between
LAPTOP/DRONE and DRONE/DUT.

As a backend you will need, depending on the test: AP/PPPoE Server/DHCP/DNS/...


How do i run a test
-------------------

The simplest test is the connectivity test. This will make the drone grab an
IPV4 using DHCP from the DUT and wget http://openwrt.org/index.html.

----
$ ./qa.py test/example.connectivity.json
